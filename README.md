# conditionals-spring-boot

A small Java library that provides additional Spring Boot conditional annotations for environment-driven configuration selection.

## Motivation

Spring Boot provides general-purpose condition mechanisms such as `@ConditionalOnProperty` and `@ConditionalOnExpression`. These cover many scenarios, but they can be insufficient when you need:

- Explicit, type-oriented comparisons (for example, numeric comparisons rather than string equality).
- Predictable evaluation rules and error handling without relying on dynamic expression languages.
- Repeatable, composable conditional declarations with well-defined evaluation order.

Use this library when:

- You need simple, explicit conditions for configuration classes or `@Bean` methods based on property values.
- You want comparison behavior to be expressed declaratively in annotations (including ordering, case handling, and negation where applicable).

Do not use this library when:

- You need to express complex boolean logic across multiple unrelated inputs (prefer explicit configuration code or Spring Expression Language).
- You require conditions that depend on arbitrary runtime state beyond the Spring `Environment`.
- You require the full flexibility of SpEL or custom condition implementations.

## Features

- **Property-based conditions**
  - String property matching with configurable match modes.
  - Integer property comparisons with ordering semantics.
  - Float property comparisons with ordering semantics and a defined equality tolerance.
  - Enum property matching with explicit enum type conversion.
- **OS-based condition**
  - Substring match against the resolved `os.name` value.
- **Repeatable annotation support**
  - Repeatable variants for property-based conditions with encounter-ordered evaluation and AND aggregation.
- **Explicit semantics**
  - Documented evaluation order, missing-property behavior, and conversion handling.

## Installation

### Maven

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.maksymuimanov</groupId>
    <artifactId>conditionals-spring-boot</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation "io.github.maksymuimanov:conditionals-spring-boot:1.0.0"
}
```

## Usage

### Example configuration properties

```properties
app.mode=prod
app.threads=8
app.ratio=0.75
app.level=INFO
```

### Example annotated class

```java
import io.conditionals.condition.ConditionalOnEnumProperty;
import io.conditionals.condition.ConditionalOnFloatProperty;
import io.conditionals.condition.ConditionalOnIntegerProperty;
import io.conditionals.condition.ConditionalOnStringProperty;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
@ConditionalOnStringProperty(prefix = "app", name = "mode", havingValue = "prod")
@ConditionalOnIntegerProperty(
        prefix = "app",
        name = "threads",
        havingValue = 4,
        matchType = ConditionalOnIntegerProperty.MatchType.GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL
)
@ConditionalOnFloatProperty(prefix = "app", name = "ratio", havingValue = 0.75f)
@ConditionalOnEnumProperty(prefix = "app", name = "level", havingValue = "INFO", enumType = Level.class)
class ConditionalConfiguration {
    enum Level { TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR }
}
```

### Explanation of behavior

- Conditions are evaluated by Spring Boot during configuration processing for `@Configuration` classes and `@Bean` methods.
- For repeatable conditions, annotation instances are evaluated in encounter order and aggregated with AND semantics: the annotated element matches only if all instances match.
- Within a single annotation instance, property names are evaluated in declared array order.
- Missing properties yield a non-match unless the annotation provides `matchIfMissing=true`.

## Supported Conditions

| Annotation | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@ConditionalOnStringProperty` | Matches based on one or more string properties using a selectable match mode. | Supports `ignoreCase`, `trim`, `not`, and match modes `EQUALS`, `CONTAINS`, `STARTS_WITH`, `ENDS_WITH`, `MATCHES` (regex via `String#matches`). Repeatable; container: `@ConditionalOnStringProperties`. |
| `@ConditionalOnIntegerProperty` | Matches based on integer property comparison. | Supports `not` and comparison modes `EQUALS`, `GREATER_THAN`, `LESS_THAN`, `GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL`, `LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL`. Repeatable; container: `@ConditionalOnIntegerProperties`. |
| `@ConditionalOnFloatProperty` | Matches based on float property comparison. | Supports `not` and comparison modes `EQUALS`, `GREATER_THAN`, `LESS_THAN`, `GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL`, `LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL`. Equality uses absolute tolerance `0.00001F`. `NaN` is treated as non-matching. Repeatable; container: `@ConditionalOnFloatProperties`. |
| `@ConditionalOnEnumProperty` | Matches based on enum constant equality. | Property and candidate are normalized using `Locale.ROOT` upper-casing and converted via `Enum#valueOf`. Invalid values are treated as non-matching. Repeatable; container: `@ConditionalOnEnumProperties`. |
| `@ConditionalOnOs` | Matches based on the current OS name. | Resolves `os.name` from the Spring `Environment`, falling back to `System.getProperty`. Matches if any configured token is a substring of the resolved OS name (case-insensitive via `Locale.ROOT`). |

## Design Principles

- **Type-safety**
  - Conditions are expressed using typed annotation attributes (for example, `int havingValue()` and `float havingValue()`) rather than string-only comparisons.
- **Predictability**
  - Evaluation order and aggregation rules are explicit and documented.
  - Missing-property behavior is explicit via `matchIfMissing`.
- **AOT / Native Image friendliness**
  - Conditions rely on Spring Boot’s standard conditional infrastructure and environment property conversion.
  - No dynamic expression parsing is required.
- **Fail-fast philosophy**
  - Invalid annotation configuration (such as specifying both `name` and `value`, or specifying neither) is rejected during condition evaluation.
- **Explicit semantics over dynamic expressions**
  - Comparisons are provided as dedicated match modes rather than arbitrary expressions.

## Comparison

### `@ConditionalOnProperty`

- **Pros**
  - Built-in and widely used.
  - Suitable for presence checks and simple string-based comparisons.
- **Trade-offs relative to this library**
  - Comparisons are primarily string-oriented and do not directly express ordering comparisons for numeric values.
  - More complex rules often require custom code or additional indirection.

### `@ConditionalOnExpression`

- **Pros**
  - Highly flexible; can express complex boolean logic.
- **Trade-offs relative to this library**
  - Uses expression parsing and evaluation.
  - Behavior depends on expression correctness and runtime evaluation rules.

## Thread Safety

- Annotation types are immutable metadata.
- Condition implementations provided by this library are stateless and therefore thread-safe.
- Thread-safety of the Spring `Environment` and `ConditionContext` is managed by the Spring container.

## Error Handling

- **Invalid annotation configuration** (for example, specifying both `name` and `value`, or specifying neither) results in an `IllegalStateException` during condition evaluation.
- **Property conversion errors** (for example, a non-numeric value for an integer condition) are treated as non-matching for the affected property key.
- **Regex patterns** used with `@ConditionalOnStringProperty(matchType = MATCHES)` are evaluated via `String#matches`; invalid patterns may raise `PatternSyntaxException`.

## AOT / Native Image Support

This library does not introduce custom reflection requirements beyond Spring Boot’s conditional processing. Behavior under AOT/native builds depends on your Spring Boot and GraalVM configuration, and on whether the relevant `Environment` property sources are available at runtime.
